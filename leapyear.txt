Here the whole explanation of the code is given.

Step-by-step to explain how it determines whether a given year is a leap year or not:

1. year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? ")): 
This line prompts the user to enter a year, and the input is stored in the variable year 
after converting it to an integer using int().

2. Leap Year Condition:
The main logic for determining a leap year is expressed using the following condition:

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0:

Let's break this down:

- year % 4 == 0: This checks whether the year is divisible by 4, which is one of the 
  conditions for a leap year.
- year % 100 != 0: This checks whether the year is not divisible by 100. If it's divisible 
  by 100, it means it could be a century year (e.g., 1900, 2000), so it must meet the additional 
  condition of being divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
- year % 400 == 0: This checks whether the year is divisible by 400, which is another condition 
  for a leap year. Century years that are divisible by 400 are leap years, like the year 2000.

Using the or operator, the code checks if either the first condition (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) 
or the second condition year % 400 == 0 is true. If either condition is true, it means the year is a 
leap year.

3. Leap Year Explanation:
If the year is determined to be a leap year based on the above condition, the script will print 
"Leap year" and then provide an explanation as to why it is a leap year:

print(f"Because {year} is cleanly divisible by 4 and not by 100.")
or
print(f"Because {year} is cleanly divisible by 400.")

It will mention whether the year is cleanly divisible by 4 and not by 100, or it is cleanly 
divisible by 400 (in case of a century leap year).

4. Non-Leap Year Explanation:
If the year does not meet the leap year condition, it means it is a normal year. The script will 
then print "Normal year" and provide an explanation for why it is not a leap year:

print(f"Because {year} is NOT divisible by 4 or is divisible by 100 but not by 400.")

The explanation clarifies that the year is not divisible by 4 or is divisible by 100 (century year)
 but not by 400, so it is a normal year.
